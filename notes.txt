I want to set up a id password for everyone: for eg. I put it as Name : Anil and password ANil123. similarly I want to do it for the whole team. I want it in a way that the moment someone filters their name it asks for a password. and for All Team members the password would be id: master, password: master 123. can we implement this now. I want it in the lead portal. I don't mind if people can access dashboard. I want the password to be stored and mapped directly in my code no db required. ALso i need a smppth designed popup to be integrated.
